## What is Anti-NSFW?

<p><a href="https://ant1nsfw.github.io" class="btn" target="_blank">Official Anti-NSFW site</a></p>

Anti-NSFW is a project made by T0P0ICHH and RD that blocks NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content on your browser.
- 500+ sites are already blocked by Anti-NSFW.

Sites not blocked? Not working? Or having other issues? They can be fixed, just create a new Issue in GitHub and you will let us know :-)
<p>We are also looking for Android and Linux developers to help us make the project better! Do a pull request if you can help us</p>

##### Project is currently in beta
